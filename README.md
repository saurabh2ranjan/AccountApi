Running test(s)[End Point Testing and Mockito/Junit with 90% code coverage]
================================================================================

1. All unit test cases have been covered by using Mockito/Junit API. Jacoco report generated can be generated by using command mvn clean package. The report is generated  in the project target folder @AccountApi\target\jacoco-ut. View the index.html file to see the code coverage details.

2. Application can be tested using in-built Swagger plugin.

    URL : http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html

3. The application has been built with the following assumption(s):

   a. Account number is unique for the user.
